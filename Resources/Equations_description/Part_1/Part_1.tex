\begin{equation}\tag{1}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[ x_{t+1} -\sigma (i_{t}-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})\right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Equation 2}
% equation 2%
\begin{equation}\tag{2}
    \pi_{t}=\beta\cdot M^{f} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]+\kappa\cdot x_{t}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ the discount factor
    \item $c_{t}$ the consumption of the houshold at time $t$
    \item $N_{t}$ the work of the household at time $t$
    \item $\gamma$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to the consumption, i.e. the importance of consumption in the utility function
    \item $\phi$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to work, i.e. the importance of work in the utility function
\end{itemize}

%There is some computation between (3) and (4) !!!%

\subsubsection*{Equation 4}

    \item $c_{\tau}$ is the aggregate level of consumption
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 15}

    \item $\bm{X}{\tau}=(\bm{X}^{\mathcal{M}}{\tau}, \Pi_{\tau})$ is the extended macro state vector, with $\bm{X}^{\mathcal{M}{\tau}}$ the vector of macro variables, including $\zeta{\tau}$ and possible announcements about future policy
    \item $\Pi\left(\bm{X}{\tau}\right):=p{\tau}-p_{t}=\pi_{t+1}+...+\pi_{\tau}$ is the inflation between times $t$ and $\tau$
    \item $q_{it}-\Pi(\bm{X}{\tau})=q{i\tau}$ is the real price of the firm if they didn't change its price between $t$ and $\tau$

\begin{equation}\tag{16}
    \max_{q_{it}} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\sum_{\tau=t}^{\infty}(\beta\theta)^{\tau-t} \frac{c\left(\bm{X_{\tau}}\right)^{-\gamma}}{\left(\bm{X_{t}}\right)^{-\gamma}} \varv\left(q_{it},\bm{X}{\tau}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model solution}

\subsubsection*{Equation 18}
\begin{equation}\tag{18}
    \hat{c}_{t}=\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}_{t+1}-\frac{1}{\gamma R}\hat{r}_{t}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (18) is the linearized version of the Euler equation obtained from the presented model. It is also called the investment-savings (IS) curve, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{c}_{t}$ is the value of the deviation from the steady state of the aggregate consumption at time $t$
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}_{t+1}\right]$ is the rational expectation of the value of the deviation from the steady state of the aggregate consumption at time $t+1$
    \item $\gamma$ is the factor of the importance of consumption
    \item $R:=1+\bar{r}$ is defined from the real interest rate at the steady state (cf. page 7 of the article)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 19}
\begin{equation}\tag{19}
    \hat{c}_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}_{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}_{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (19) is the application of Lemma 1 (equation (11)) on the previous Euler equation, i.e. a cognitively discounted aggregate Euler equation, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 20}
\begin{equation}\tag{20}
    N^{\phi}_{t}=\omega_{t}c_{t}^{\gamma}
\end{equation}

Equation (20) the result of the static First Order Condition for labor supply, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_{t}$ is the quantity of labor provided at time $t$
    \item $\omega_{t}$ is the real wage at time $t$
    \item $c_{t}$ is the aggregate quantity of consumption at time $t$
    \item $\gamma$ is the consumption importance in the utility
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 21}
\begin{equation}\tag{21}
    \hat{c}_{t}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (21) is the equation giving us the consumption in a natural economy where there are no frictions in prices i.e. flexible price economy. where :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{c}_{t}^{n}$ is the flexible price/natural economy consumption 
    \item $\gamma$ is the the elasticity of substitution between goods. 
    \item $\phi$ is the Frisch elasticity of labour
    \item $\zeta_{t}$ is the Total Factor prodcutivity

We calculate this natural economy consumption the same way we calculated the flexible price economy consumption using the log-linearised version of the natural economy price, first-order condition for labour supply, and market clearing condition for consumption and income. 
\end{itemize} is the flexible price/natural economy consumption

\subsubsection*{Equation 22}
\begin{equation}\tag{22}
    \hat{c}^{n}_{t} = M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}^{n}_{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}^{n}_{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (22) is the application of Lemma 1 (equation (11)) on the previous Euler equation, i.e. a cognitively discounted aggregate Euler equation for the natural economy where there are no price frictions. Here : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ is the real interest rate for the natural economy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 23}
\begin{equation}\tag{23}
    r^{n0}_{t}=\bar{r}+\frac{1+\phi}{\sigma(\gamma+\phi)}\left(M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\zeta_{t+1}\right]-\zeta_{t}\right)
\end{equation}
Equation (23) is the equation for the pure natural rate of interest: this is the interest rate that prevails in an economy without pricing frictions, and undisturbed by government policy (in particular, budget deficits). In this equation : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r^{n0}_{t}$ is pure natural rate of interest
    \item $\gamma$ is the the elasticity of substitution between goods. 
    \item $\phi$ is the Frisch elasticity of labour
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\zeta_{t}$  and $\zeta_{t+1}$ is the Total Factor productivity in time $t$ and $t+1$ 
        respectively
\end{itemize}
    
This pure natural interest rate is calculated by isolating the $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ in Equation (22) and then replacing $\hat{c}_{t}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t}$ , $\hat{c}_{t+1}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t+1}$ and $\hat r_{t}^{n}=r_{t}^{n}-\bar{r}$ and by assuming $r_{t}^{n}=r^{n0}_{t}$ which holds when there are no budget deficits. 

\subsubsection*{Equation 24}
\begin{equation}\tag{24}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[x_{t+1}\right]-\sigma(\hat{r}_{t}-\hat{r}^{n}_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (24) is the equation for the behavioural discounted Euler equation where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{t}$ is the output gap at period $t$
    \item $x_{t+1}$ is the output gap at period $t+1$
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $\hat r_{t}$ is the deviation of the real interest rate from the steady state.
    \item $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ is the deviation of the real interest rate from the steady state for the natural economy.
\end{itemize}

This is calculated by subtracting the expression $\hat{c}_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}_{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}_{t}$ i.e. Equation (19) and $\hat{c}^{n}_{t} = M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{c}^{n}_{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}^{n}_{t}$ i.e. Equation (22)

\subsubsection*{Equation 25}
\begin{equation}\tag{25}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[x_{t+1}\right]-\sigma(i_{t}-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (25) is the behavioural discounted Euler equation after replacing the equation for Fisher equation  where $\hat r_{t}= r_{t}- \bar r = (i_{t}-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i_{t}$ is the nominal interest rate
    \item $\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]$ is the expected inflation in the future
    \item $M=\bar{m}$
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 26}
\begin{equation}\tag{26}
    x_{t}=-\sigma\sum_{k\geq 0}{M\cdot \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\hat{r}_{t+k}-\hat{r}_{t+k}^{n}\right]}
\end{equation}

Equation (26) iteratively using Equation (24) reduces to this equation. It indicates that changes in the interest rate in the $1000^{th}$ period will have a discounted impact on the output gap. Therefore, the effect of changes in interest rates on the output gap diminishes over time, with changes in the $1000^{th}$ period having a smaller impact compared to changes in the $1^{st}$ period.


\subsubsection*{Equation 27}
\begin{equation}\tag{27}
    p^{*}_{t}=p_{t}+(1-\beta\theta)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\beta\theta\bar{m}\right)^{k}\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}+...+\pi_{t+k}-\mu_{t+k}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (27) is the optimal price for a behaviourial firm resetting its price
\begin{itemize}
    \item $p^{*}_{t}$ is the the price a behaviourial firm will reset its price to. 
    \item $\bar{m}$ is the cognitive discounting factor. 
    \item $p^{*}_{t}= q{it}+p_{t}$ where $q_{it}$ is the linearised version of the maximisation solution to problem 17. $q_{it}$ is the price for the firms that can adjust their prices and $p_{t}$ is the price of the firms that can't adjust their prices.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 28 - Proposition 2, the first equation}
\begin{equation}\tag{28}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[x_{t+1}\right]-\sigma(i_{t}-\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (28) is the Behavioural IS Curve. Essentially we are representing the Euler equation in terms of the output gap and also using the Fisher Equation.

\subsubsection*{Equation 29 - Proposition 2, second equation}
\begin{equation}\tag{29}
    \pi_{t}=\beta\cdot M^{f} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\pi_{t+1}\right]+\kappa\cdot x_{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (29) is the Behavioural Phillips curve where: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M^{f}$ is the aggregate attention parameter for firms and $M^{f}=\bar{m}\left(\theta+\frac{1-\beta\theta}{1-\beta\theta\bar{m}}(1-\theta)\right)$
    \item $\kappa=\widetilde{\kappa}$  is the slope of the Phillips curve and $\widetilde{\kappa} =  \frac{(1-\theta)(1-\beta\theta)}{\theta}(\gamma+\phi)$ which is the slope obtained from fully rational firms. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 30}
\begin{equation}\tag{30}
    \begin{cases}
        M=\bar{m} \\
        \sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R} \\
        M^{f}=\bar{m}\left(\theta+\frac{1-\beta\theta}{1-\beta\theta\bar{m}}(1-\theta)\right)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Equation (30) defines the parameters in Proposition 2.
