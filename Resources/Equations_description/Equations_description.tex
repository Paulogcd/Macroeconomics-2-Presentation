\maketitle

This file aims to summarise and give some all the equations of the presented article. Its goal is to serve as a complement to the presentation of May 3, 2024 in the Macroeconomics 2 class. 
Although we use the same numerisation of the equations as in the article, we do present them in our own structure, following the oral presentation divided in three main sections. 
The sections of the article are however given as subsections, to provide some additional information for those wanting to use this document as a complementary helper to the reading of the article.

\section{A Behavioral Model}
Let's ignore the first two equations since they are the same as (28) and (29), that will be explained later.

\subsection{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{Equation 1}
% equation 1%
\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[ x{t+1} -\sigma (i_{t}-\mathbb{E}t\left[\pi{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})\right]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{Equation 2}
% equation 2%
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{t}=\beta\cdot M^{f} \mathbb{E}t\left[\pi{t+1}\right]+\kappa\cdot x_{t}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Basic Setup and the Householdâ€™s Problem}

\subsubsection*{Equation 3}
% equation 3%
\begin{equation}
    U = \mathbb{E}t \left[ \sum{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^{t}\left(\frac{c_{t}^{1-\gamma}-1}{1-\gamma} - \frac{N_{t}^{1+\phi}}{1+\phi}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (3) is just the flow utility of the Household, with : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ the discount factor
    \item $c_{t}$ the consumption of the houshold at time $t$
    \item $N_{t}$ the work of the household at time $t$
    \item $\gamma$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to the consumption, i.e. the importance of consumption in the utility function
    \item $\phi$ determines the concavity of the utility function with respect to work, i.e. the importance of work in the utility function
\end{itemize}

%There is some computation between (3) and (4) !!!%

\subsubsection*{Equation 4}
% equation 4%
\begin{equation}
    k_{t+1}=(1+r_t)(k_{t}-c_{t}+y_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (4) is the law of motion of the real financial wealth of the household, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k_t$ is the real financial welath of the household at time $t$
    \item $r_t$ is the real interest rate
    \item $w_t$ is the real wage
    \item $y_t$ is the agent's real income, defined as $y_t=w_t\cdot N_{t}+y_{t}^{f}$, with $y_{t}^{f}$ the profit income (or the income from firms) at time $t$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 5}

% equation 5%
\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}{t+1}=\bm{G}^{\bm{X}}\left(\bm{X}{t},\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1}\right)
\end{equation}

Equation (5) describes the evolution of macroeconomic variables, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bm{X}_t$ is the state vector, including several macroeconomic variables of time $t$, like $\zeta_t$ the aggregate TFP, and the announced actions in monetary and fiscal policy
    \item $\bm{G}^X$ the equilibrium transition function, i.e. the function that gives the macroeconomic variables at time $t+1$ from the macroeconomic variables at the previous period
    \item $\epsilon_{t}$ is the innovation in the economy at time $t$, with $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\epsilon{t+1}\right]=0$, that depends on the equilibrium policies of the agent and of the government
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 6}

% equation 6%
\begin{equation}
    k_{t+1}=G^{k}(c_{t},N_{t}, k_{t}, \bm{X}t):= (1+\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}{t}))(k_{t}+\bar{y}+\hat{y}(N_{t},\bm{X}t)-c{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (6) is the application of the consideration of a set of macroeconomic variables on the law of motion of real financial wealth $k_{t}$, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{r}$ is the steady state value of the real interest rate, that does not depend on time
    \item $\hat{r}(\bm{X}t)$ is the value of the deviation from the steady state of the real interest rate, that depends on the state vector $\bm{X}{t}$ at time $t$
    \item $\bar{y}$ is the steady state value of the agent's real income, that does not depend on time
    \item $\hat{y}(N_{t},\bm{X}_{t})$ is the deviation from the steady state of the agent's real income, that depends on the number of hours worked at time $t$ and on the state vector at time $t$
    \item $c_{t}$ is the aggregate consumption level at time $t$ of the agent
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 7}

% equation 7%
\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}{t+1}=\bm{\Gamma}\bm{X}{t}+\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Gamma$ is a squared matrix that multiplies the state vector
    \item $\bm{X}_t$ is the state vector at time t
    \item $\epsilon_{t}$ is the innovation shock
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 8 (Assumption 1)}

% equation 8%
\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}{t+1}=\bar{m}\cdot\bm{G}^{\bm{X}}(\bm{X}{t},\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1})
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{m}\in\left[0n1\right]$ is the cognitive discount factor measuring the attention to the future
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 9}

% equation 9%
\begin{equation}
    \bm{X}{t+1}=\bar{m}(\bm{\Gamma}\bm{X}{t}+\bm{\epsilon}_{t+1})
\end{equation}

Equation (9) is just the linearized version of the perception by behavioral agents of the law of motion of the state vector. 

\subsubsection*{Equation 10}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[\bm{X}{t+k}\right]=\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\bm{X}{t+k}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (10) defines the expectation of behavioral agents in function of the rational perception of the law of motion of the state vector, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[\bm{X}{t+k}\right]$ is the expected value of the state vector at time $t+k$ by behavioral agents (or subjective/behavioral expectation operator)
    \item $\bar{m}^{k}$ is the cognitive discounting effect at period $t+k$
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\bm{X}{t+k}\right]$ is the rational expectation of the state vector at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 11 (Lemma 1)}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[z\left(\bm{X}{t+k}\right)\right]=\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}{t}\left[z\left(\bm{X}{t+k}\right)\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (11) defines in the general case the behavioral expectation operator, for any function of the state vector, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context
    \item $z(\cdot)$ is a function, such that $z(0)=0$
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[z\left(\bm{X}{t+k}\right)\right]$ is the expected value of the image of the state vector by the function $z(\cdot)$ at time $t+k$ by behavioural agents
    \item $\bar{m}^{k}$ is the cognitive discounting effect at period $t+k$
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[z\left(\bm{X}{t+k}\right)\right]$ is the rational expectation of the image of the state vector by the function $z(\cdot)$ at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 12}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[\bar{r}+\hat{r}\left(\bm{X}{t+k}\right)\right]=\bar{r}+\bar{m}^{k}\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{r}(\bm{X}{t+k})\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (12) is an example of the Lemma 1 applied to the interest rate, where :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $k\geq 0$ a time period in discrete context
    \item $\bar{r}$ the steady state level of the real interest rate, that does not depend on time,  
    \item $\hat{r}(\bm{X}_{t+k})$ is the equilibrium transition function defining the value of the deviation from the steady state of the real interest rate in the function of the state vector at time $t+k$
    \item $\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}{t})=r{t}(\bm{X}_{t})$ is the value of the real interest rate at time $t$
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}^{BR}\left[\bar{r}+\hat{r}(\bm{X}{t+k})\right]$ is the expected value of the real interest at time $t+k$ by behavioural agents
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{r}(\bm{X}{t+k})\right]$ is the rational expectation of the value of the deviation of the real interest rate from the steady state at time $t+k$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Firm's problem}

\subsubsection*{Equation 13}
\begin{equation}
    P_{t}=\left(\int_{0}^{1}P_{it}^{1-\varepsilon}\,di\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\varepsilon}}
\end{equation}

Equation (13) describes the aggregate price level, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P_{t}$ is the aggregate price level of the economy at time $t$
    \item $i\in\left[0,1\right]$ is the firm index
    \item $\varepsilon$ is the elasticity of substitution between goods
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 14}
\begin{equation}
    \varv^{0}(q_{i\tau},\mu_{\tau},c_{\tau}):=\left(e^{q_{i\tau}}-(1-\tau_{f})e^{-\mu_{\tau}}\right)e^{-\varepsilon q_{i\tau}}c_{\tau}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\varv$ is the real profit of the firm
    \item $q_{i\tau}=\text{ln}\left(\frac{P_{i\tau}}{P_{\tau}}\right)=p_{i\tau}-p_{\tau}$ is the real log price at time $\tau$
    \item $\tau_f=\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ it the corrective wage subsidy from the government, funded by the lump sum tax
    \item $\mu_{\tau}=\zeta_{t}-\text{ln}(\omega_{t})$ is the labor wedge, which is zero at efficiency
    \item $\varepsilon$ is the elasticity of subsititution between goods
    \item $c_{\tau}$ is the aggregate level of consumption
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 15}
\begin{equation}
    \varv\left(q_{it},\bm{X}{\tau}\right):=\varv^{0}\left(q_{it}-\Pi(\bm{X}{\tau}),\mu(\bm{X}{\tau}),c(\bm{X}_{\tau})\right)
\end{equation}

Equation 15 describes the flow profit of the firm in function of the real log price and of the extended macro state vector, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $q_{it}=\text{ln}\left(\frac{P_{it}}{P_{t}}\right)=p_{it}-p_{t}$ is the real log price
    \item $\bm{X}{\tau}=(\bm{X}^{\mathcal{M}}{\tau}, \Pi_{\tau})$ is the extended macro state vector, with $\bm{X}^{\mathcal{M}{\tau}}$ the vector of macro variables, including $\zeta{\tau}$ and possible announcements about future policy
    \item $\Pi\left(\bm{X}{\tau}\right):=p{\tau}-p_{t}=\pi_{t+1}+...+\pi_{\tau}$ is the inflation between times $t$ and $\tau$

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 16}
\begin{equation}
\max_{\text{q}{it}} \mathbb{E}{t} \sum_{\tau=t}^{\infty}(\beta\theta)^{\tau-t} \frac{c\left(\bm{X_{\tau}}\right)^{-\gamma}}{\left(\bm{X_{t}}\right)^{-\gamma}} \varv\left(q_{it},\bm{X}{\tau}\right)
\end{equation}

Equation (16) describes the maximisation program of the firm given that they have a Calvo-like probability of $\theta$ of being able to change their price at each period, where : 

\begin{itemize}
    \item $t$ is the initial period

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 17}
\begin{equation}
    \max_{q_{it}}{\mathbb{E}{t}^{BR} \left[\sum{\tau=t}^{\infty}(\beta\theta)^{\tau-t}\frac{c\left(\bm{X}{\tau}^{-\gamma}\right)}{c\left(\bm{X}{t}^{-\gamma}\right)} \varv\left(q_{it,\bm{X}_{\tau}}\right) \right]}
\end{equation}

    \item $\frac{c\left(\bm{X}{\tau}^{-\gamma}\right)}{c\left(\bm{X}{t}^{-\gamma}\right)}$ is the adjustment in the stochastic discount factor between times $t$ and $\tau$ and it is approximately 1 when linearised around deterministic steady state. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model solution}

\subsubsection*{Equation 18}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{c}{t}=\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}{t+1}-\frac{1}{\gamma R}\hat{r}{t}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (18) is the linearized version of the Euler equation obtained from the presented model. It is also called the investment-savings (IS) curve, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{c}_{t}$ is the value of the deviation from the steady state of the aggregate consumption at time $t$
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}{t+1}\right]$ is the rational expectation of the value of the deviation from the steady state of the aggregate consumption at time $t+1$
    \item $\gamma$ is the factor of the importance of consumption
    \item $R:=1+\bar{r}$ is defined from the real interest rate at the steady state (cf. page 7 of the article)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 19}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{c}{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (19) is the application of Lemma 1 (equation (11)) on the previous Euler equation, i.e. a cognitively discounted aggregate Euler equation, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 20}
\begin{equation}
    N^{\phi}{t}=\omega{t}c_{t}^{\gamma}
\end{equation}

Equation (20) the result of the static First Order Condition for labor supply, where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N_{t}$ is the quantity of labor provided at time $t$
    \item $\omega_{t}$ is the real wage at time $t$
    \item $c_{t}$ is the aggregate quantity of consumption at time $t$
    \item $\gamma$ is the consumption importance in the utility
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 21}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{c}{t}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (21) is the equation giving us the consumption in a natural economy where there are no frictions in prices i.e. flexible price economy. where :
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\hat{c}_{t}^{n}$ is the flexible price/natural economy consumption 
    \item $\gamma$ is the the elasticity of substitution between goods. 
    \item $\phi$ is the Frisch elasticity of labour
    \item $\zeta_{t}$ is the Total Factor prodcutivity

We calculate this natural economy consumption the same way we calculated the flexible price economy consumption using the log-linearised version of the natural economy price, first-order condition for labour supply, and market clearing condition for consumption and income. 
\end{itemize} is the flexible price/natural economy consumption

\subsubsection*{Equation 22}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{c}^{n}{t} = M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}^{n}{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}^{n}{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (22) is the application of Lemma 1 (equation (11)) on the previous Euler equation, i.e. a cognitively discounted aggregate Euler equation for the natural economy where there are no price frictions. Here : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ is the real interest rate for the natural economy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 23}
\begin{equation}
    r^{n0}{t}=\bar{r}+\frac{1+\phi}{\sigma(\gamma+\phi)}\left(M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\zeta_{t+1}\right]-\zeta_{t}\right)
\end{equation}
Equation (23) is the equation for the pure natural rate of interest: this is the interest rate that prevails in an economy without pricing frictions, and undisturbed by government policy (in particular, budget deficits). In this equation : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $r^{n0}_{t}$ is pure natural rate of interest
    \item $\gamma$ is the the elasticity of substitution between goods. 
    \item $\phi$ is the Frisch elasticity of labour
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\zeta_{t}$  and $\zeta_{t+1}$ is the Total Factor productivity in time $t$ and $t+1$ 
        respectively
\end{itemize}
    
This pure natural interest rate is calculated by isolating the $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ in Equation (22) and then replacing $\hat{c}{t}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t}$ , $\hat{c}{t+1}^{n}=\frac{1+\phi}{\gamma+\phi}\zeta{t+1}$ and $\hat r_{t}^{n}=r_{t}^{n}-\bar{r}$ and by assuming $r_{t}^{n}=r^{n0}_{t}$ which holds when there are no budget deficits. 

\subsubsection*{Equation 24}
\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[x{t+1}\right]-\sigma(\hat{r}{t}-\hat{r}^{n}{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (24) is the equation for the behavioural discounted Euler equation where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_{t}$ is the output gap at period $t$
    \item $x_{t+1}$ is the output gap at period $t+1$
    \item $M$ is the macro parameter of attention, such that $M=\bar{m}$ here
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$ 
    \item $\hat r_{t}$ is the deviation of the real interest rate from the steady state.
    \item $\hat r_{t}^{n}$ is the deviation of the real interest rate from the steady state for the natural economy.
\end{itemize}

This is calculated by subtracting the expression $\hat{c}{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}{t}$ i.e. Equation (19) and $\hat{c}^{n}{t} = M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{c}^{n}{t+1}\right]-\sigma\hat{r}^{n}{t}$ i.e. Equation (22)

\subsubsection*{Equation 25}
\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[x{t+1}\right]-\sigma(i_{t}-\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\pi{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (25) is the behavioural discounted Euler equation after replacing the equation for Fisher equation  where $\hat r_{t}= r_{t}- \bar r = (i_{t}-\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\pi{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})$
\begin{itemize}
    \item $i_{t}$ is the nominal interest rate
    \item $\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\pi{t+1}\right]$ is the expected inflation in the future
    \item $M=\bar{m}$
    \item $\sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R}$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 26}
\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=-\sigma\sum_{k\geq 0}{M\cdot \mathbb{E}{t}\left[\hat{r}{t+k}-\hat{r}_{t+k}^{n}\right]}
\end{equation}

Equation (26) iteratively using Equation (24) reduces to this equation. It indicates that changes in the interest rate in the $1000^{th}$ period will have a discounted impact on the output gap. Therefore, the effect of changes in interest rates on the output gap diminishes over time, with changes in the $1000^{th}$ period having a greater impact compared to changes in the $1^{st}$ period.


 \subsubsection*{Equation 27}
\begin{equation}
    p^{*}{t}=p{t}+(1-\beta\theta)\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\beta\theta\bar{m}\right)^{k}\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\pi{t+1}+...+\pi{t+k}-\mu_{t+k}\right]
\end{equation}

Equation (27) ..., where : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 28 - Proposition 2, the first equation}
\begin{equation}
    x_{t}=M\cdot\mathbb{E}{t}\left[x{t+1}\right]-\sigma(i_{t}-\mathbb{E}{t}\left[\pi{t+1}\right]-r^{n}_{t})
\end{equation}

Equation (28) is the Behavioural IS Curve. Essentially we are representing the Euler equation in terms of the output gap and also using the Fisher Equation.

\subsubsection*{Equation 29 - Proposition 2, second equation}
\begin{equation}
    \pi_{t}=\beta\cdot M^{f} \mathbb{E}t\left[\pi{t+1}\right]+\kappa\cdot x_{t}
\end{equation}

Equation (29) is the Behavioural Phillips curve where: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $M^{f}$ is the aggregate attention parameter for firms and $M^{f}=\bar{m}\left(\theta+\frac{1-\beta\theta}{1-\beta\theta\bar{m}}(1-\theta)\right)$
    \item $\kappa=\widetilde{\kappa}$  is the slope of the Phillips curve and $\widetilde{\kappa} =  \frac{(1-\theta)(1-\beta\theta)}{\theta}(\gamma+\phi)$ which is the slope obtained from fully rational firms. 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Equation 30}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{cases}
        M=\bar{m} \\
        \sigma=\frac{1}{\gamma R} \\
        M^{f}=\bar{m}\left(\theta+\frac{1-\beta\theta}{1-\beta\theta\bar{m}}(1-\theta)\right)
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Equation (30) defines the parameters in Proposition 2.
