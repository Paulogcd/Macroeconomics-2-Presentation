This file aims to summarise and give some all the equations of the presented article.
Its goal is to serve as a complement to the presentation of May 3, 2024 in the Macroeconomics 2 class. 
We use the same numerisation of the equations as in the article.
This file can also be considered as a complementary helper to the reading of the article.
