# Macroeconomics 2 Presentation

Welcome on this Repository.

It hosts all the material of one of the presentation I did while in the Master of Research in Economics of Sciences Po. It  was the review of the article "A Behavioral New Keynesian Model‚Äù by Xavier Gabaix, and it was presented in "Macroeconomics 2", to the class and to the Teaching Assistant Naomi Cohen. 

This presentation was done with two of my colleagues : MITASH Nayanika and WANG Shang, who were with me in the Master at Sciences Po.
